Resources for deep learning

Below are some of the best resources I've come across for deep learning across various topics. These are probably only resources you need to watch/read if you are refreshing your knowledge or learning from scratch.
This list specifically targets Convolution Neural Networks for imaging applications and in general theory of deep learning.

*obiviously I've not gone through all the material available on the net on the topic of deep learning. But, whatever I've come across these are the best ones*

## Installation guide for tensorflow, keras on windows

One additional problem I came across was that tensorflow only works with python 3.6. So, one needs to set environment for python 3.6 and then do a pip install.
